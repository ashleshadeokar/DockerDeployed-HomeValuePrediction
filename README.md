# Boston House Price Prediction Web Application with Dockerized Deployment

## Overview:
This project implements a web application for predicting house prices in Boston using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression. The application is built using Flask and is deployed using Docker for easy setup and scalability. Below are the steps involved in completing the project.

## Steps Completed:
1. **Understanding the Dataset:** Analyzed the Boston house prices dataset to understand its structure and features.
2. **Preparing Dataset And Basic Analysis:** Preprocessed the dataset, handled missing values, and conducted basic exploratory data analysis.
3. **Preparing Dataset For Model Training:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets in preparation for model training.
4. **Training The Model:** Utilized linear regression to train a model on the prepared dataset.
5. **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
6. **Prediction Of New Data:** Implemented functionality to make predictions on new data using the trained model.
7. **Pickling the Model File:** Serialized the trained model into a file using pickle for future use.
8. **Setting Up Github And VS Code:** Established a repository on GitHub and set up Visual Studio Code for collaborative development.
9. **Creating A New Environment:** Created a virtual environment for the project to manage dependencies.
10. **Setting up Git:** Configured Git for version control and collaboration.
11. **Creating A FLASK Web Application:** Developed a web application using Flask to facilitate user interaction.
12. **Running And Testing the Application:** Tested the functionality of the web application locally to ensure correctness.
13. **Prediction From Front End Application:** Enabled users to input data via the front end and obtain predictions from the trained model.
14. **Procfile for Heroku Deployment:** Created a Procfile to specify the commands needed to run the application on the Heroku platform.
15. **Deploying The App To Heroku:** Deployed the web application on Heroku for public access.
16. **Deploying The App Using Docker:** Dockerized the application for streamlined deployment and scalability.
